# Data Structures

## What is a Data Structure?

A Data Structure is a collection of values, an arrangement of data. The values can have relationships among them and they can have functions applied to them. Each one is different in what it can do, and what it is best used for.

Think of a Data Structure as a container for storing items. Such as a backpack, box, file-folder, shelf, refrigerator, and more. I am not going to store my homework in the refrigerator, or all of my important files and papers in my backpack or a box because they can get crumpled.

> A way for us to organize data. We can put things in them, and take them out.

## Data Structures

- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Tries
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

- Breadth-First Traversal (BFS) + Depth-First Traversal (DFS) (searching)
- Recursion

# Arrays

## Static vs Dynamic

Static Arrays mean that they're fixed in size. You should specify the number of elements that the array will hold ahead of time.

Dynamic Arrays allow us to copy and rebuild the array at a new location.

# Objects

## Reference Type

## Context

## Instantiation
