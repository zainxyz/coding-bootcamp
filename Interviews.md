## What are companies looking for?

> Companies are looking for people who know how to look for answers, and that you know your data structures and algorithms, and you know of their existence.

2. Coding Skills - Do you code well, by writing clean, simple, organized, readable code?
3. Technical knowledge - Do you know the fundamentals of the job you're applying for?
